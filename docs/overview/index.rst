Overview
========

Morango is a database replication engine for Django, written in pure Python, that
supports *Peer to Peer* syncing of data. Morango is structured as a Django application that
can be included in a Django project in order to make specific application models syncable.

Morango includes the following features:

1. a certificate-based authentication system to protect privacy and integrity of data
2. change-tracking system to support calculation of differences between databases
   across low-bandwidth connections, and handle merge conflict resolution

Objectives
----------
There are several high-level goals (often competing with one another) in the design of Morango, including:

- **Privacy**: Data should only be synced to the devices which are authorized to access that data, and made available to users with the appropriate permissions.
- **Ease** of use: The sync process should be as streamlined and hands-off as possible.
- **Efficiency**: Storage, bandwidth, and processing power all come at a premium and requirements should be minimized.
- **Integrity**: We need to avoid corruption of data, protecting it from either accidental or malicious damage.
- **Flexibility**: In some cases, we may, for instance, only want to sync a subset of the data from a database (e.g. the data for a particular user).
- **Peer to Peer network**: Devices should be able to communicate without a central server.
- **Eventual Consistency**:  If no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

Example User Story
------------------
Lets set up a scenario where we have three devices. ``Device A`` is in a remote area, ``Device B`` is in the city, and ``Device C`` is in the cloud/internet.
``Device B`` seeks to retrieve the data from ``Device A``. In order to achieve this, ``Device B`` must travel to the remote area. Once
``Device B`` arrives to the remote area, ``Device B`` syncs the data from ``Device A``. As ``Device B`` makes its way back to the city, ``Device A``
is able to connect to the internet and syncs its data to ``Device C``. When ``Device B`` returns to the city, it attempts to sync to ``Device C``,
but since ``Device C`` already has the data from ``Device A``, no data is transferred. Ultimately, ``Device A``, ``B``, and ``C`` have the same data, and are said to be in sync.

Problems to be addressed
------------------------
With any syncing system, there are certain problems that need to be solved in order to address the objectives above:

- In order to make the system efficient as possible, we only want to sync *new* data between devices
- We never want to lose data, as that could affect the consistency of the system as a whole
- Part of keeping the integrity of the system requires syncing data as snapshots
- For cases where data may collide when being edited and synced from multiple sources, the system should be able to resolve the conflicts
- Unauthorized users or systems should not be able to access/sync data they do not have permissions for
- Data across different systems must be unique, which prevents data collisions from malicious or normal syncing

High-Level Data Structures and Flow
-----------------------------------
Certificate Exchange
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the first actions that must occur is an exchange of certificates between two morango instances.
This ensures that both sides have the proper permissions to sync the data.

``Certificates`` - grants varying levels of permissions for syncing

Sync Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The next step is the actual exchange of data in a sync session. A sequence of steps initializes, prepares, and exchanges data between
the morango instances.
A general push sync scenario follows steps in this order:

1. ``Serialization`` - process of serializing data that is associated with Django models in the Application layer, and storing it in JSON format in a record in the ``Store``

2. ``Queuing/Buffering`` - process of storing, in separate `Buffers` data structure, serialized records and their modification history which need to be sent during the data transfer

3. ``Transfer/chunking of data`` - actual transfer of data over a request/response cycle in 500 (default) record chunks

4. ``Dequeuing`` - process of merging the data received in the ``Buffers`` to ``Store`` and ``RecordMaxCounter`` layer

5. ``Deserialization`` - process of merging data from the ``Store`` layer into the Django models in the Application layer

.. image:: ./img/sync_process.png

``Store`` - serialized (JSON) versions of app models

``RecordMaxCounter`` - instance modification history

``Buffer`` - transfer holding space for serialized versions of app models

``RecordMaxCounterBuffer`` - transfer holding space for instance modification history

``App models`` - underlying application's django models
